Fundamentally, through Hiring Hub, we aim to use tech to facilitate better relationships between employers and recruitment agencies. We created an online marketplace because it's a meritocracy. Hiring Hub is proven to help employers fill jobs 3x faster, typically in just 20 days. For transparency, recruitment agency terms and fees are fixed upfront.

Care Hires,https://www.linkedin.com/company/carehires,"Care Hires was born out of the growing frustration experienced by Care Homes, towards the outdated recruitment and temporary staffing processes within the Care industry. When additional staffing is required, high agency fees, and low quality workers are common problems faced day to day by Care Home Managers and Owners. Care groups made up of multiple services that require agency staffing typically have to manage these agency rotas through excel spreadsheets and email confirmations. This process alone causes confusion and costly error leading to overbilling and time waste, just managing these assignments. This growing problem has been an issue for Care Hires’ team for many, many years. We took up the challenge of finding another way. The team commenced an 18-month research and development process set on revolutionising the industry. Care Hires was launched to the wider public March 2020, and through this 12 month period, we refined and developed our platform based on Care Home feedback. Forward to April 2021, our platform now empowers brilliant Agency Providers and their high quality compliant staff, to complete assignments with Care Groups who manage their entire rota through our Care Hires platform. We have one goal, and that’s to support our Nation's Care Services through advanced technology and unparalleled service.","Recruitment, Staffing, Careworkers, Care Agencies, and Technology",<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77326b0>,46,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b0d0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77318f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b3f0>,1786 Tara Lock,The Dock,75,+1-983-560-3375x30912,https://www.linkedin.com/company/carehires,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b850>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b490>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b8f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b990>,753.561.6986x07395,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77324d0>,LinkedIn

Loowatt Ltd,https://www.linkedin.com/company/loowatt-ltd,"Loowatt is a revolutionary waterless toilet system that creates local economies around waste treatment. Our toilet system saves water and produces energy—the opposite of today’s toilet status quo. Quick to set up and simple to service and operate, the Loowatt system is a closed-loop human waste treatment solution. Having gained support from the InnovationRCA Incubator in 2010, we have built an impressive multidisciplinary network of collaborators, and won a Grand Challenges Explorations grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011 to “create the next generation of sanitation technologies.” We are an interdisciplinary team of designers, engineers and businesspeople, committed to creating a paradigm shift in sanitation. The system: The toilet uses a unique sealing mechanism to package feces and urine into an odourless container, within a recyclable or compostable liner.

That story then became the Lotus Foods story. Since 1995, Lotus Foods has built strong partnerships around the world to bring you the highest quality gluten-free heirloom, organic rice, rice noodles and rice ramen. All while promoting organic agriculture, rice biodiversity and supporting producers. As a certified B Corp, the company’s intent and vision is not only to help rice farmers earn a living wage but to bring healthier rice choices to consumers. To this end, Lotus Foods’ commitment to organic and regenerative practices is generating more rice from less land, preserving biodiversity, saving millions of gallons of water annually, promoting soil health, and removing greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere. Lotus Foods’ traditional Brown and White Basmati Rice is the first rice in the world to achieve Regenerative Organic Certified®.

HutanBio,https://www.linkedin.com/company/hutanbio,"How do you decarbonise an industry which moves across vast oceans for 330 days a year, uses 200Mn tonnes of diesel fuel a year, and requires its fleet to be operational for +30 years? Where fuel needs to be available, cost-effective, and compatible with existing and future technology whilst remaining compliant. It’s a big challenge and a complex one at that! As consumers become increasingly climate aware, it’s no surprise that shipping industry customers are demanding a transition to low-carbon fuels. As it stands, existing suppliers cannot scale. Although shipping and long-haul transportation only contribute around 3% of transportation carbon emissions, they provide a critical service and are the foundations on which global trade exists. As measures are introduced to reduce unnecessary transport carbon missions, the rich and wanderlust may find it an inconvenience if they can no longer travel on a whim - but stop shipping, and food doesn’t reach those that need it the most. Basic human commodities that need to flow, won’t. ~ At HutanBio we believe we have the answer and are on a mission to prove that Mother Nature does indeed hold the answers. 10 years of painstakingly thorough scientific research, long hours, and personal sacrifice. Seven relentless years on a floating lab, battling impossible heat and sea sickness, dredging the sea for samples to get to the point where there is a viable commercial opportunity to scale. Over a Trillion sample colonies scrutinised; whittled down to just 80. It’s a mission fuelled by a powerful belief, a dogged determination to set right the wrongs of humanity, and to show through scientific data that micro-biodiversity holds the key to unlocking the climate crisis. It has resulted in the discovery of a new genus; an entire family of microorganism, new to Science.

Atlantic Money,https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlanticmoney,"Atlantic Money is on a mission to bring equality to the global money transfer market. As Co-Founders Patrick & Neeraj researched the global FX market they discovered that big institutions move unlimited money around the world at effectively zero cost, securing the live exchange rate by working directly with one another. The progressive fees that retail customers are being charged by existing money transfer providers do not exist – in fact, the cost of sending money internationally is largely fixed per transaction, even when sending large amounts. Customers who have family or financial commitments abroad such as mortgages, credit cards, investments, tuition fees are all being charged unjustifiable fees by all the incumbents. Atlantic Money is putting an end to this. With a friction-free app, plus a technology platform that cuts out the middleman, it directly connects everyday customers to an institutional-grade currency transfer solution. Now, pricing previously reserved for the banks will be available to regular customers, making the cost of larger transfers with Atlantic Money unbeatable versus all other money transfer providers on the market. Atlantic Money is the only international money transfer provider to offer the live exchange rate and a flat fixed fee of £3 for transfers all the way up to £1,000,000.","Fintech, international transfers, money, remote work, transactions, finance, iOS, Android, startup, remittances, and UK",<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77326b0>,14,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b0d0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77318f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b3f0>,1786 Tara Lock,London,GB,+1-983-560-3375x30912,https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlanticmoney,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b850>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b490>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b8f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b990>,753.561.6986x07395,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77324d0>,LinkedIn

Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by giving brands the power to use this data to unlock body-relative apparel design. Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has led to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.

Behind the Book,https://www.linkedin.com/company/behind-the-book,"Behind the Book’s mission is to strengthen literacy in students from low-income communities with programs that bring books to life. Working directly in the classroom, in partnership with the teacher, our expert staff develops programs around a specific piece of contemporary urban literature and its author. A series of workshops builds on the book and approaches the writing process from every angle, bringing the book to life for the kids. With books in their hands and inspiration in their classrooms, kids read, write, and illustrate their own stories. Behind the Book serves New York City public schools - exclusively those at which 75% or more of the student population lives at or below the federal poverty line. Our programs are designed to strengthen reading engagement, which literacy professionals identify as a key criteria needed to develop reading, writing and communication skills. All Behind the Book programs are incorporated into class curricula and meet Common Core Learning Standards. We work closely with each classroom’s teacher to select an author whose book will resonate with students, reflect the classroom’s diversity, and match the students’ capabilities. We develop a custom program centered on the book, and transition the reading material into writing projects. Programs incorporate more than author visits – there are writing coaches and research aides; arts projects and field trips. Many culminate with Behind the Book designing and publishing an anthology of the students’ work and providing copies for each student to keep. We gift books to the students and donate additional books to the classroom and school libraries. This school year, we are working with nearly 2,000 students, and have committed to distributing over 10,000 books.","Literacy, K-12 Education, Reading Engagement, and Urban Literature",<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77326b0>,32,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b0d0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77318f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b3f0>,1786 Tara Lock,216 West 135th Street,Ne,+1-983-560-3375x30912,https://www.linkedin.com/company/behind-the-book,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b850>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b490>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b8f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b990>,753.561.6986x07395,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77324d0>,LinkedIn

Tornado - A Bruker Company,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tornado-spectral-systems,"Tornado - A Bruker Company designs, manufactures, and sells chemical analysis & measurement systems primarily for Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique but Raman systems have traditionally been limited by a lack of sensitivity due to the input slit trade-off between resolution and throughput. Tornado’s proprietary high throughput virtual slit (HTVS™) design technique eliminates spectrometer slit losses while maintaining high spectral resolution, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity.

Madhu Chocolate,https://www.linkedin.com/company/madhuchocolate,"Madhu Chocolate is a company born out of a passion for combining traditional Indian flavors with the decadence of chocolate. From our humble beginnings in a kitchen in Austin, TX, we set out to create the highest quality bean-to-bar product. We source our cacao from the Tumaco region of Colombia and Idukki Hills region in Kerala, India, then meticulously roast, crack, winnow, grind, flavor, temper, and wrap all our bars by hand. Our inspiration comes from many sources, but one that stands out is Harshit's mom. Her inventive recipes and incredible chai have fueled Harshit's lifelong passion for food, and she continues to inspire us every day. It's fitting, then, that we named our business after her: Madhu, which means honey or sweet in Hindi. To us, it represents the perfect name for a chocolate company.

Our “Trade credit as a service” technology empowers B2B merchants to offer credit terms to their business customers instantly, even on their first purchase. In turn, customers benefit from additional payment terms through a frictionless checkout experience. Over 30% of B2B trade takes place on credit terms, with trade credit representing the largest source of business financing in advanced economies. Yet current processes for offering trade credit are outdated and not fit for the digital age. Hokodo’s digital platform solves these issues by offering merchants a powerful set of solutions to manage trade credit and scale with confidence. Merchants that integrate with Hokodo see on average a 40% increase in revenues. Gone are the days of paper-based trading account applications, manual credit decisions and cumbersome sales journeys. Our easy-to-integrate digital platform streamlines the entire order-to-cash process, allowing merchants to make credit decisions in real-time, be protected against bad debt and get access to working capital finance options. We also protect merchants by insuring against the credit risk with Lloyd’s of London, and arrange the financing with our partners so our sellers can get paid upfront if they choose. We’ve believed for a long time that the design and distribution of financial products has been broken, and we’ve been on a journey to fix it since.

Jobseekers struggle to get feedback or transparency on their application, they feel treated like a number and find the process clunky, demoralising and even soul destroying. They know they need to send out a very high number of applications to get a response so that’s what they do, making the problem worse. We don’t accept such a poor experience in any other setting.

Our work is guided by the core principles of adaptability, impact, inclusion, innovation and transparency. By enabling community-driven development, Elevated Chicago will position station areas as civic assets where programming and the built environment converge to create nodes of opportunity and connection across the region’s vast transit system. Our work began around seven Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) or ehubs. But today, ETOD is everywhere in Chicago, and we've expanded from seven eHubs to nearly two dozen Elevated Chicago Plus communities. Our ETOD Working Group helped create the City of Chicago's first ETOD Policy Plan. We've helped to award grants to create 11 ETOD Policy Plan demonstration projects. And our programs that include the Equitable Development Ambassadors, the J.E.D.I. (Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion) cohort with the Metropolitan Planning Council, and our annual symposium are inviting more and more people to understand and advocate for ETOD.

Typically, parents/students end up paying education fees in lump sums as institutes don’t have the right payment solutions to offer flexible payment options. Jodo’s suite of products - Jodo Cred, Jodo Flex, and Jodo Pay - are custom-built recurring payment solutions that allow parents/students to pay their fees in a manner most convenient to them. Our products increase fee realization for institutes by locking in cashflows while taking away the hassle of fee collection. We seamlessly enable the entire fee collection process - fee structure creation, notification, settlements, and reconciliation - and give fee collection visibility via smart analytics to management and finance teams. By opting to pay via Jodo’s payment plans, parents also become a part of Jodo’s parent community and get access to high-quality content, exclusive events, and curated awards - all aimed at enriching the student’s learning journey. Jodo is started by three co-founders, who have a pedigreed education background (IIT/IIM) and relevant experience in financial services (ex-Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Edelweiss Capital). Jodo is backed by high-quality investors. • VC investors: Tiger Global, Elevation Capital, Matrix Partners - investors in Paytm, Swiggy, Urban Company, Ola, Practo • Angel investors: Kunal Shah (CRED), Nithin Kamath (Zerodha), Amit Ranjan (SlideShare) If Jodo’s mission excites you, share what you can bring to the table at careers@jodopay.com","Finance, School Fees, EMIs, Live Events, Rewards, Parent Community, education payments, and fintech",<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77326b0>,317,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b0d0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77318f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b3f0>,1786 Tara Lock,100 Feet Road,Be,+1-983-560-3375x30912,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jodopay,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b850>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b490>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b8f0>,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e6c7b990>,753.561.6986x07395,<function <lambda> at 0x7ea4e77324d0>,LinkedIn
